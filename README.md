<h1>Description</h1>
The E-commerce ORM API is a backend server application designed to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing products, categories, and tags in an e-commerce system. The API is built using Node.js with Express.js framework and utilizes Sequelize ORM for interacting with the MySQL database.

## Technologies Used:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Sequelize ORM
- MySQL
- Insomnia (for testing API endpoints)
- Dotenv (for environment variables)

## Project Structure:

1. server.js: Main entry point of the application, initializes the Express server and sets up routes.
2. routes/: Directory containing route handlers for different API endpoints (products, categories, tags).
3. models/: Contains Sequelize model definitions for database tables (Product, Category, Tag).
4. controllers/: Controllers for handling business logic and interacting with the database.
5. middlewares/: Middleware functions for request validation, authentication, and error handling.
6. config/: Configuration files for database connection and environment variables.
7. seeds/: Data seeding scripts for populating the database with sample data.

# Usage:

- Clone the project repository from GitHub.
- Install dependencies using npm.
- Set up environment variables for database connection.
- Run the server using npm start.
- Use Insomnia or any API testing tool to interact with the API endpoints.
